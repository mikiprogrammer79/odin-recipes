    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Panna cotta is a traditional, easy, and delicious Italian custard. It tastes just like the panna cotta served at Italian restaurants.</p>
        <p>Serve with warm hot fudge sauce and fresh raspberries on top. This keeps well for several days in the refrigerator.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>⅓ cup skim milk</li>
            <li>1 (.25 ounce) envelope unflavored gelatin</li>
            <li>2 ½ cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour milk into a small bowl. Sprinkle gelatin powder over milk and stir until combined. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Stir heavy cream and sugar together in a saucepan. Set over medium heat and bring to a boil; watch carefully as the cream can quickly bubble up and boil over.</li>
            <li>Immediately stir gelatin mixture into boiling cream, stirring until completely dissolved. Cook and stir for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Remove the pan from the heat and stir in vanilla.</li>
            <li>Pour cream mixture into 6 individual ramekins. Leave to cool, uncovered, until no longer warm, about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>When cool, cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until set, at least 4 hours but preferably overnight.</li>
